# EDeA Measurement Server

An API to store, view and reason about measurements.

This project is based on the original EDeA Project proposal and takes further inspiration from the [TestOps Manifesto by Keysight](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/assets/7018-06546/white-papers/5992-3771.pdf).

## Current Status

We're using and developing this at Fully Automated for our OSHW and consulting projects. It's in a usable state, but currently only used internally. If you intend to use this, please contact us so we can understand the usecase of other engineering teams better.

## Future Plans

The next step will be to create a python client for the measurement api and some examples with pymeasure.
Data processor integration (via the jobqueue) and possible JupyterLite integration are also on the list, but not highest priority.
